# Bevan's Wiki
Bevan's Wiki is an experimental FOSS wiki solution written in Python using Flask and SQLite, licensed under the MIT License. It is not yet stable or feature heavy for adoption. If you are interested in setting up a serious wiki, I personally recommend MediaWiki (it powers Wikipedia!).

One key element of Bevan's Wiki is customization. This is achieved through skinning, and can be done so by modifying the files in *templates*.

## To-Do
- Beautify the default templates
- Add support for formatting (bold, italics, underline), embedded images, and inline links
- Add a config file for stuff like database, password length, username requirements, etc.

## Contributing
Open a pull request to contribute changes. I suggest chipping away at the to-do list, but feel free to do whatever.
